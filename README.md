# Research Impact

As a new member of the Research Impact Team (RIT) of our organization, there are a lots for me to learn. This serves as a place for me to collect
materials related to RIT.

1. [Laiden Ranking] (https://www.leidenranking.com/)
    - Rank more than 1200 major universities in the world
    - Ranking indicators: 
        - **scientific impact**, colloboration, open access publishing, and gender diversity
        - both size dependent and size independent options
        - multidimensional perspectives
        - publication centered: 
            - based on Web of Science by Clarivate Analytics
            - publications in conference or journals not indexed by WoS are not counted.
        - independence: doesn't rely on the ranked university to provide information
